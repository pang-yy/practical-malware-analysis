## Basic Static Analysis

### Antivirus Scanning

### Hashing

- Used to uniquely identify malware
- Commonly used hash algorithms: 
  - Message-Digest Algorithm 5 (**MD5**)
  - Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (**SHA-1**)
- The hash can:
  - use as a label
  - share with other analysts
  - search online to see if the file has already been identified

Tools can be used: [md5deep](https://md5deep.sourceforge.net/) to generate hash

### Strings

- A program contain strings if it:  
  - prints messages
  - connects to a URL
  - copies file to a specific location
- Searching through the strings can be a simple way to get hints about the functionality of a program

#### ASCII and Unicode

_Microsoft uses the term **wide character string** to describe its implementation of Unicode strings, which varies from the Unicode standards. Throughout this book, when we refer to Unicode, we are referring to the Microsoft implementation._

- String end with a **NULL terminator** to indicate end of string
- ASCII strings use 1 byte per character
  - Example: _BAD_ will be stored as 
    - B: 0x42 
    - A: 0x41 
    - D: 0x44 
    - \0: 0x00
- Unicode strings use 2 bytes per character
  - Example: _BAD_ WILL BE stored as 
    - B: 0x42 0x00
    - A: 0x41 0x00
    - D: 0x44 0x00
    - \0: 0x00 0x00

Tools can be used: Strings (for Windows, download the [Sysinternals Suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite))

### Packed and Obfuscated Malware
